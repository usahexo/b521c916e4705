are some reasons someone might stop using flowers as gifts","date":"2022-08-26T03:07:25.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are some reasons someone might stop using flowers as gifts?\n\nThere are a few reasons why people might stop using flowers as gifts. The first reason might be because flowers die quickly and the receiver might not appreciate the sentiment behind the gift. The second reason might be because flowers are often quite expensive, and people may start to see them as a waste of money. The third reason might be because some people view giving flowers as a clichéd or stale gesture.\n\n#  Are there any benefits to stopping using flowers as gifts?\n\nWhen it comes to gift-giving, flowers are perhaps one of the most popular choices. After all, who can resist their beauty and fragrance? However, some people are beginning to wonder if there might be any benefits to stopping using flowers as gifts.\n\nHere are a few reasons why you might want to consider skipping the flowers next time you need to buy a gift:\n\n#1 They’re not eco-friendly\n\nFlowers are often seen as a symbol of freshness and new beginnings, but the reality is that they’re anything but eco-friendly. In fact, the production of flowers is incredibly harmful to the environment. Not only do they require a lot of water and pesticides, but they also produce large amounts of CO2 emissions.\n\n#2 They’re not always affordable\n\nFlowers may seem like a relatively affordable gift option, but the truth is that they can be quite pricey, especially if you’re looking for something high quality. For example, roses can cost anywhere from $5 to $10 per stem. And if you’re buying an arrangement or bouquet, the price tag will be even higher.\n\n#3 They don’t always last long\n\nAnother downside of flowers is that they don’t always last long. In fact, most bouquets only last for about five days before wilting and dying. This means that you either have to throw them away or find someone who can use them (which can be tricky).\n\n#  What could people use in place of flowers as gifts?\n\nFlowers make beautiful and unique gifts, but sometimes people might not have access to flowers or might want to give a different type of gift. There are many other items that can be used in place of flowers as gifts.\n\nOne option is to give a gift that is edible. This could be something like candy, chocolate, or a basket of fruit. These gifts are generally appreciated by most people and they are easy to find.\n\nAnother option is to give a gift that is personal or sentimental. This type of gift could be something like a frame with a picture of the two of you, a book about your relationship, or even a piece of jewelry. These gifts show that you put thought into the present and that you care about the person you are giving it to.\n\nYou could also give a gift that is practical. This might be something like a new shirt, a scarf, or a pair of socks. These gifts are useful and the person can use them right away. They also don’t take up much space, which can be important if the person you are giving the gift to doesn’t have much room for extra clutter.\n\n Ultimately, the best thing to do is to think about what the person you are giving the gift to would like best. If you aren’t sure, ask them!

One way is to stop growing them. This would mean that the flower industry would shrink, and people would no longer have access to fresh flowers. Another way is to make it more expensive to buy flowers. This could be done by increasing the taxes on flowers, or by making it illegal to import them into the country.

But what really is the meaning of gift?\n\nThe dictionary defines gift as ‘a thing given voluntarily to someone without payment’. But there is more to it than that. A gift has a deeper meaning, it is a symbol of love and appreciation.\n\nA gift is a way of showing your loved ones that you care about them and want to make them happy. It can be something small or something big, but the most important thing is the thought behind it.\n\nSo this Christmas, don’t just go out and buy the first thing you see. Take some time to think about what your loved ones would really appreciate and then go ahead and give them the perfect gift!\n\n#  What is the most popular gift?\n\nThe answer to this question is subjective, as what one person considers the \"most popular gift\" may not be the same as what another person believes. However, there are some gifts that tend to be more popular than others, and depending on the occasion, there may be a certain type of gift that is more commonly given.\n\nOne of the most popular gifts during the holiday season is usually a gift card. According to a 2016 study by the National Retail Federation, gift cards were the most requested item from Santa Claus, with almost half of all children asking for one. Gift cards can be used for a variety of purposes, such as shopping at a particular store or restaurant, or even for withdrawing cash.\n\nAnother popular gift option is jewelry. Whether it is for a special occasion like an anniversary or Valentine's Day, or just as a general present, jewelry is often well-received by the recipient. In fact, in 2017 global jewelry sales reached nearly $80 billion. There are many different types of jewelry to choose from, so there is likely something to suit everyone's taste.\n\nHome décor is another option that tends to be popular among gift-givers. This could include items like candles, throw blankets, or even furniture. Home décor can be a great option because it allows the recipient to decorate their home according to their own style and taste. Additionally, since home décor items often come in a range of prices, it can fit any budget.\n\nFinally, another common gift choice is clothing. Whether it is for a man or woman, clothing is always appreciated by the recipient. Men's clothing in particular can be difficult to shop for, but with so many different styles and brands available today, it is easier than ever to find something that the recipient will love.\n\n#  Why do people give gifts?\n\nOne of the greatest mysteries of life is why people give gifts. Why do we spend so much time, money and effort on something that doesn't seem to have any obvious benefit for us?\n\nThere are a few different theories about why people give gifts. The most common theory is that gifts are a way of expressing love or appreciation. When you give someone a gift, you're telling them that you care about them and you want to make them happy.\n\nAnother theory is that gifts are a way of building relationships. Gifts show that you're interested in the other person and that you want to get to know them better. They also create a sense of obligation in the recipient, which can lead to future cooperation or favors.\n\nA third theory is that gifts are a way of conveying status or power. By giving someone a lavish gift, you're signaling to them that you're more important or powerful than they are. This can be used as a way of getting favor or status in return.\n\nRegardless of why we give gifts, there's no doubt that they play an important role in our lives. Gifts can make us feel loved, appreciated and connected to others. They can also be a source of joy and happiness, especially when we receive something we really love or need. So next time you're faced with the question of what to give someone, remember that there's no one right answer - just go with what feels best for you!\n\n#  What was your best gift ever received?\n\nThe best Christmas present I ever received was a puppy. I had always wanted a dog, and my parents were able to surprise me with one on Christmas morning. I was so excited and loved spending time with my new furry friend.\n\n#  What is the best way to wrap a gift?\n\nWhen it comes to gift-giving, there are a lot of different ways to wrap a present. But what is the best way? Well, that depends on the gift and the wrapping material you have available.\n\nIf you have a lot of wrapping paper, one popular way to wrap a gift is to start by wrapping it in a small square of paper. Then, take the larger piece of paper and fold it into a triangle. Place the gift in the middle of the triangle and wrap the two corners of the triangle around the gift. Finally, use tape to hold everything in place.\n\nAnother option is to use a large piece of wrapping paper and fold it in half so that it’s long enough to cover the gift. Then, fold each end towards the center so that it forms an accordion-style package. Finally, tie a ribbon around it and you’re done!\n\nIf you don’t have any wrapping paper, you can always use tissue paper or newspaper. For tissue paper, simply crumple up some sheets until they’re small enough to fit around the gift. Then, unfold them and stick them to the gift with some tape. If you’re using newspaper, roll it into a tube shape and then secure it with some tape.\n\nNo matter which method you choose, always make sure that your package is secure so that your gift doesn’t fall out during transport. And most importantly, have fun with it! The more creative you get with your wrapping, the more excited your loved ones will be when they open their presents.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-meaning-of-gift.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the meaning of gift\ndate: 2022-09-21 17:32:49\ncategories:\n- Flower\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the meaning of gift?\n\nChristmas is around the corner and everyone is busy looking for the best gift for their loved ones.

Led by Coca-Cola, one of the world's most valuable and recognizable brands, the company's portfolio includes 19 billion-dollar brands including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Dasani水and POWERADE。 Additionally, the company offers a wide range of waters, juices and juice drinks, teas and coffees。\n\nUnilever is one of the world's largest consumer goods companies with products sold in over 190 countries.

The casino has been well-received by industry analysts, who believe that it will be successful in the Polish market. Here are some of the reasons why Rox Casino is expected to be a success in Poland:\n\n1. Rox Casino offers a high-quality gaming experience.\n\nOne of the reasons why industry analysts believe that Rox Casino will be successful in Poland is because the casino offers a high-quality gaming experience. Rox Casino has teamed up with several leading software providers, including NetEnt, Microgaming, and Play’n GO, to ensure that its games are of the highest quality. Players can enjoy a range of premium slots, table games, and live dealer games at Rox Casino.\n\n2. The casino offers generous bonuses and rewards.\n\nAnother reason for the casino’s expected success is its lucrative bonus and rewards programme. Players can earn rewards for playing their favourite games, as well as for making deposits and participating in promotions. There are also plenty of bonus offers available, giving players the chance to boost their bankrolls significantly.\n\n3. Rox Casino is licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission.\n\nRox Casino is licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, which means that it is an authorised and safe gambling destination. Players can rest assured that their funds are safe and that they will be treated fairly at all times when playing at Rox Casino. The casino also employs state-of-the-art security measures to protect player data and funds.\n\n#  How does Rox Casino plan to differentiate itself from its competitors in Poland?\n\nRox Casino plans to differentiate itself from its competitors in Poland mainly by its unique and innovative games, as well as its excellent customer service. In addition, Rox Casino will offer some exclusive promotions that players will not be able to find at any other casino. Finally, Rox Casino’s website will be easy to use and players will be able to find all the information they need quickly and easily.\n\n#  What challenges does Rox Casino anticipate facing in the Polish market?\n\nRox Casino is looking to expand its reach by entering the Polish market, but it faces a few key challenges. One challenge is that gambling is tightly regulated in Poland and there are a number of restrictions on how casinos can operate. For example, casinos are not allowed to offer their services to Polish citizens. In order to overcome this challenge, Rox Casino will need to partner with a Polish-based company that is authorized to operate casinos in the country.\n\nAnother challenge for Rox Casino is that there is already a well-established casino industry in Poland. This means that Rox Casino will face stiff competition from existing operators. To compete, Rox Casino will need to offer its customers something unique and value-added. This could include things like better customer service, more games and bonuses, or unique amenities like restaurants and spas.\n\nFinally, Rox Casino will need to be aware of the cultural sensitivities in Poland when it comes to gambling. For instance, there is a strong anti-gambling sentiment in some segments of Polish society. This could make it difficult for Rox Casino to attract new customers or convince existing ones to switch providers. In order to overcome this challenge, Rox Casino will need to do a good job of promoting the benefits of gambling and stressing its responsible gaming practices.","source":"_posts/Why-did-Rox-Casino-choose-to-set-up-in-Poland.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Why did Rox Casino choose to set up in Poland\ndate: 2022-09-22 23:03:17\ncategories:\n- Rox Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Why did Rox Casino choose to set up in Poland?\n\nRox Casino is a young and ambitious company that has chosen to set up in Poland.

Subsequently, Igrosoft developed a number of well-known games for different platforms, including vector graphics arcade game Battle City (Namco) and puzzle game Dr. Mario (Nintendo), as well as a number of games for home computers such as Iznayova Office (a suite of business applications), Klondike (a solitaire card game), and others.</p>\n<p>Igrosoft also ported a large number of games from other developers to Russian platforms, including some popular Western titles such as Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Igrosoft released the Yarovaya law case where they revealed that they were asked by the Federal Security Service to create a backdoor into their software products that are widely used in Russia such as Windows XP and Office 2003. Igrosoft did not agree to this request and refused to include the backdoors. This made them liable to criminal charges under Russian anti-terrorism legislation passed in 2002 known as the Yarovaya law. After two years of investigation during which Igrosoft employees were harassed by Federal Security Service agents, the case was eventually dropped in 2008 for lack of evidence.</p>\n"},{"title":"What is RB88","date":"2022-09-27T06:33:26.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What is RB88?\n\nRB88 is a web-based casino platform that offers a variety of gaming options to players.

For one, it's important to make sure that the casino you're playing at is legitimate and licensed. You can do this by checking out the website's licensing information or looking for reviews of the casino online.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is that not all casinos offer the same games. So, if you're looking to play a specific game, be sure to check out the casino's game selection first. You'll also want to make sure that the casino offers fair and reputable gaming practices. One way to do this is by checking out the casino's payout percentage.\n\nFinally, always remember to gamble responsibly and never spend more than you can afford to lose.\n\n#  Are there any risks associated with playing at an online casino?\n\nThere are a few risks associated with playing at an online casino.

So if anything comes up while you’re playing, you’ll be able to get help right away.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-do-I-choose-the-right-game-to-play\"><a href=\"#How-do-I-choose-the-right-game-to-play\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How do I choose the right game to play?\"></a>How do I choose the right game to play?</h1><p>So you want to play a game, but you don’t know which one to choose. Maybe you’re looking for something new, or maybe you just want to find the perfect game for a specific occasion. With so many games out there, it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you.</p>\n<p>Here are a few tips that can help you choose the right game:</p>\n<p>#1: Consider your interests</p>\n<p>What kind of things do you like to do? What are your hobbies and interests? There are games out there for everyone, so it’s important to consider what kinds of games interest you. If you’re not sure, ask your friends and family members what kinds of games they like. You might be surprised by the variety of options out there.</p>\n<p>#2: Consider your mood</p>\n<p>Are you in the mood for a fast-paced action game, or would you prefer something more relaxing? Consider your mood and try to find a game that matches it. If you’re feeling stressed out, try playing a puzzle game or something that doesn’t require a lot of concentration. If you’re feeling bored, try an action game or something that’s new to you.</p>\n<p>#3: Consider your budget</p>\n<p>Games can be expensive, and not everyone can afford to buy new games all the time. If price is a concern for you, consider looking for older games that are on sale or borrowing games from friends or family members. There are also a number of free games available online. Just make sure that the game is appropriate for your age group.</p>\n<p>#4: Consider who you’ll be playing with</p>\n<p>If you’ll be playing with others, it’s important to consider their preferences as well. Not everyone enjoys the same types of games, so it’s important to find something that everyone will enjoy playing. If possible, try to demo the game before purchasing it so that you can be sure it’s right for your group.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-should-I-look-for-in-an-online-casino\"><a href=\"#What-should-I-look-for-in-an-online-casino\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What should I look for in an online casino?\"></a>What should I look for in an online casino?</h1><p>If you’re looking for a great online casino experience, there are several things you should look for before signing up.</p>\n<p>The first thing to consider is the casino’s licensing and regulatory status.

A proposal by Suffolk County OTB to build a casino at Belmont Racetrack is also in the running.\n\nNassau OTB's proposed casino would be built at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. The return of $10 million would be spread over three years, with $3 million each year going to the state's general fund and $1 million each year going to Nassau County.\n\nSincere said he expects the rebate will \"clear any issue of concern raised by the Gaming Commission.\"\n\nIn January, the commission raised questions about Nassau OTB's ties to labor unions and its history of financial problems.\n\n#  Nassau OTB making big plans with casino money\n\nAfter Nassau OTB announced that it is set to receive a $12.5 million payout from the casino referendum, officials say they are looking to make big plans for the money.\n\n\"This is great news for Nassau OTB and for our customers,\" said Chairman Tim Moore in a statement. \"We are looking forward to using this money to improve our facilities and enhance our customer experience.\"\n\nMoore says that the money will be used to upgrade the existing facility as well as help fund new projects, including a proposed satellite location in Garden City and an expansion of the betting platform to include international races.\n\n\"This is a significant investment in our future and will help us grow our business and better serve our customers,\" Moore said.\n\nThe $12.5 million payout is coming from the state's share of casino revenue generated by Nassau County residents. The total amount of revenue generated by casinos in the county is still being calculated, but it is estimated that it will be in the range of $100 million annually.\n\nNassau OTB has been struggling in recent years, with declining revenues and shrinking profits. The infusion of casino money is seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the organization.\n\n\"This is great news for Nassau OTB and for our customers,\" Moore said. \"We are looking forward to using this money to improve our facilities and enhance our customer experience.\"\n\n#  What will Nassau OTB do with all that casino money?\n\n\nNassau OTB is looking to invest millions of dollars in its racetracks and other gambling facilities. What will they do with all that casino money?\n\nThe head of Nassau OTB, Jason Juliano, says the organization is in a strong financial position after a successful year at the betting windows. Nassau OTB took in $239 million in bets last year, up from $225 million in 2017.\n\nMuch of that money will now go back into the gambling industry, with plans to invest $30 million in upgrades at Aqueduct Racetrack and spend another $20 million on its other facilities, including Resorts World Casino in Queens and Belmont Park.\n\n\"This is about reinvesting in our product,\" Juliano said. \"We are seeing good results and we want to continue to capitalize on that.\"\n\nThe investments come as New York gears up for expanded sports betting, which is expected to bring even more revenue to OTBs across the state. Nassau OTB is also looking into online gambling opportunities.\n\n#  Nassau OTB enjoys windfall from casino gambling\n\nNassau OTB, the organization that oversees horse racing and gambling in Nassau County, New York, has announced that it has received a $2 million windfall from casino gambling. The money will be used to fund county operations and boost the local economy.\n\n“This is great news for Nassau County,” said Nassau OTB president Tom Rogers in a statement. “The infusion of funds will help us support our horseracing and simulcasting operation, as well as provide much-needed economic stimulus to local businesses.”\n\nNassau OTB revealed that the bulk of the money, about $1.4 million, came from slot machine revenue at Resorts World Casino in Queens. The rest came from other casinos in upstate New York.\n\nRogers thanked the state legislature for its support of casino gambling and pledged to use the money “wisely and efficiently” for the benefit of county residents. He also promised that any surplus funds would be returned to the taxpayers.\n\nNassau OTB is not the only beneficiary of casino gambling revenue; the state of New York collected more than $2 billion in taxes from casinos last year.\n\n#  Casino profits help Nassau OTB erase deficit\n\nThe Nassau Off-Track Betting Corp.'s $1.5 million profit in the fiscal year that ended March 31 helped erase its deficit, officials said.\n\nNassau OTB recorded a $1.4 million loss in the previous fiscal year, officials have said.\n\nHowever, the corporation, which operates video lottery terminal facilities at nine locations in Nassau County, still owes the state more than $27 million in gambling subsidies.\n\n\"The profits we generated helped us reduce our debt to the state and position OTB for future growth,\" board Chairman Frederick Ippolito said in a statement Thursday.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended March 31, Nassau OTB's revenues totaled $13.8 million, up from $11 million in the previous fiscal year. Expenses totaled $12.3 million, down from $13.7 million.\n\nThe increase in profit was largely due to an increase in the total amount wagered by bettors, from $535 million to $584 million, officials said. \n\nCasino Profits Help Nassau OTB Erase Deficit","source":"_posts/Nassau-OTB-rebate-$10-million-to-state-for-casino-gambling.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Nassau OTB rebate $10 million to state for casino gambling\ndate: 2022-10-27 18:15:24\ncategories:\n- 7stars Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Nassau OTB rebate $10 million to state for casino gambling\n\nThe Nassau Off-Track Betting Corp. announced Monday it is rebate $10 million to the state as part of its effort to win a casino gambling license.\n\nNassau OTB President Phil Sincere said the rebate \"demonstrates our overwhelming support for a gaming facility in Nassau County and our commitment to returning a portion of our revenues to the taxpayers.\"\n\nThe state's Gaming Commission will award four casino licenses this year, one each for upstate, the Catskills, Rochester and Southern Tier.

Nassau OTB took in $239 million in bets last year, up from $225 million in 2017.</p>\n<p>Much of that money will now go back into the gambling industry, with plans to invest $30 million in upgrades at Aqueduct Racetrack and spend another $20 million on its other facilities, including Resorts World Casino in Queens and Belmont Park.</p>\n<p>“This is about reinvesting in our product,” Juliano said. “We are seeing good results and we want to continue to capitalize on that.”</p>\n<p>The investments come as New York gears up for expanded sports betting, which is expected to bring even more revenue to OTBs across the state. Nassau OTB is also looking into online gambling opportunities.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Nassau-OTB-enjoys-windfall-from-casino-gambling\"><a href=\"#Nassau-OTB-enjoys-windfall-from-casino-gambling\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Nassau OTB enjoys windfall from casino gambling\"></a>Nassau OTB enjoys windfall from casino gambling</h1><p>Nassau OTB, the organization that oversees horse racing and gambling in Nassau County, New York, has announced that it has received a $2 million windfall from casino gambling. The money will be used to fund county operations and boost the local economy.</p>\n<p>“This is great news for Nassau County,” said Nassau OTB president Tom Rogers in a statement. “The infusion of funds will help us support our horseracing and simulcasting operation, as well as provide much-needed economic stimulus to local businesses.”</p>\n<p>Nassau OTB revealed that the bulk of the money, about $1.4 million, came from slot machine revenue at Resorts World Casino in Queens. The rest came from other casinos in upstate New York.</p>\n<p>Rogers thanked the state legislature for its support of casino gambling and pledged to use the money “wisely and efficiently” for the benefit of county residents. He also promised that any surplus funds would be returned to the taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Nassau OTB is not the only beneficiary of casino gambling revenue; the state of New York collected more than $2 billion in taxes from casinos last year.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Casino-profits-help-Nassau-OTB-erase-deficit\"><a href=\"#Casino-profits-help-Nassau-OTB-erase-deficit\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Casino profits help Nassau OTB erase deficit\"></a>Casino profits help Nassau OTB erase deficit</h1><p>The Nassau Off-Track Betting Corp.’s $1.5 million profit in the fiscal year that ended March 31 helped erase its deficit, officials said.</p>\n<p>Nassau OTB recorded a $1.4 million loss in the previous fiscal year, officials have said.</p>\n<p>However, the corporation, which operates video lottery terminal facilities at nine locations in Nassau County, still owes the state more than $27 million in gambling subsidies.</p>\n<p>“The profits we generated helped us reduce our debt to the state and position OTB for future growth,” board Chairman Frederick Ippolito said in a statement Thursday.</p>\n<p>In the fiscal year that ended March 31, Nassau OTB’s revenues totaled $13.8 million, up from $11 million in the previous fiscal year. Expenses totaled $12.3 million, down from $13.7 million.</p>\n<p>The increase in profit was largely due to an increase in the total amount wagered by bettors, from $535 million to $584 million, officials said. </p>\n<p>Casino Profits Help Nassau OTB Erase Deficit</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl79w86fo0001iov58ma64s5s","category_id":"cl79w86fs0003iov58lcb59lk","_id":"cl79w86fu0004iov5368mgr51"},{"post_id":"cl8bffz0p0000vcv59qxs3tlz","category_id":"cl79w86fs0003iov58lcb59lk","_id":"cl8bffz0w0001vcv5cald1ik6"},{"post_id":"cl8d6ost30000wsv56b3i23fo","category_id":"cl8d6ost90001wsv50jpmhmkz","_id":"cl8d6ostc0002wsv55aoqgd5s"},{"post_id":"cl8eey40q0000scv5hfdmc8z4","category_id":"cl8d6ost90001wsv50jpmhmkz","_id":"cl8eey40z0001scv593ez99kg"},{"post_id":"cl8jtoe6y0000lwv5hpg706lz","category_id":"cl8d6ost90001wsv50jpmhmkz","_id":"cl8jtoe760001lwv5h9xmdoa0"},{"post_id":"cl8lli5d70000qov51e3g33of","category_id":"cl8d6ost90001wsv50jpmhmkz","_id":"cl8lli5dc0001qov54gnybiel"},{"post_id":"cl8v8s82y0000e4v52xo60ura","category_id":"cl8v8s8340001e4v5fgtp5nz9","_id":"cl8v8s83d0002e4v5b2680zqy"},{"post_id":"cl8wrw2e60000xkv5dotdbx7t","category_id":"cl8v8s8340001e4v5fgtp5nz9","_id":"cl8wrw2el0002xkv5hm5u1v50"},{"post_id":"cl92ksqv90000a4v57g3lfgnw","category_id":"cl92ksqvh0001a4v53sa829ea","_id":"cl92ksqvm0002a4v50xso4683"},{"post_id":"cl9cgvnws0000dgv502e91fgv","category_id":"cl9cgvnwz0001dgv57xhr26br","_id":"cl9cgvnx30002dgv5hmcmays2"},{"post_id":"cl9dzbg200000s8v57msdc2ki","category_id":"cl9dzbg270001s8v530593lmy","_id":"cl9dzbg2c0002s8v51fnq22wn"},{"post_id":"cl9qwtdj10000i0v50avf0jhi","category_id":"cl9dzbg270001s8v530593lmy","_id":"cl9qwtdj70001i0v55pns14tu"}],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cl8wrw2e60000xkv5dotdbx7t","tag_id":"cl8wrw2ec0001xkv56oyrhbzm","_id":"cl8wrw2eo0007xkv5dzpncfbs"},{"post_id":"cl8wrw2e60000xkv5dotdbx7t","tag_id":"cl8wrw2em0003xkv50j37c7wk","_id":"cl8wrw2eo0008xkv5fa7c42n4"},{"post_id":"cl8wrw2e60000xkv5dotdbx7t","tag_id":"cl8wrw2em0004xkv518570xgo","_id":"cl8wrw2eo0009xkv50nf0akv3"},{"post_id":"cl8wrw2e60000xkv5dotdbx7t","tag_id":"cl8wrw2en0005xkv586bvfbt0","_id":"cl8wrw2eo000axkv5a5tfhau1"},{"post_id":"cl8wrw2e60000xkv5dotdbx7t","tag_id":"cl8wrw2en0006xkv59uvw1bav","_id":"cl8wrw2eo000bxkv57mxrcydr"}],"Tag":[{"name":"Online Casino","_id":"cl8wrw2ec0001xkv56oyrhbzm"},{"name":"Online Games","_id":"cl8wrw2em0003xkv50j37c7wk"},{"name":"TV Game","_id":"cl8wrw2em0004xkv518570xgo"},{"name":"toto site","_id":"cl8wrw2en0005xkv586bvfbt0"},{"name":"baccarat site","_id":"cl8wrw2en0006xkv59uvw1bav"}]}}
