#  Bingo Dissension Big Daddy Casino: How Long Does it Take to Get My Winnings?

Some people like to go to the casino to try their luck at winning some money. And while there are different types of casino games, many people like the simplicity and excitement of playing bingo. But before you go depositing money into a bingo game, one thing you’re going to want to know is how long does it take to get your winnings?

The answer, unfortunately, is not a straightforward one. It depends on a number of factors, including the bingo site you’re playing on and your location. Generally speaking though, most online bingo sites will process payouts within 72 hours of you making a request. So if you hit the jackpot and are in need of your winnings quickly, that’s generally not going to be a problem.

However, if you’re playing at a brick-and-mortar casino, things can take a bit longer. That’s because casinos rely on slower methods like cheques and bank transfers to payout winners, which can often take several days or even weeks. So if time is of the essence and you want your bingo winnings as soon as possible, then sticking with an online site is probably your best bet.
