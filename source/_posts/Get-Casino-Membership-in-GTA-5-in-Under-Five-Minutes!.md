#  How to Get a Casino Membership in GTA 5 for Free

In Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5), there are three ways to get a casino membership for free. The first way is to complete the prerequisite mission, which is entitled “The Big Score.” The second way is to purchase a property in the game that’s worth at least $2 million. The third and final way is to accumulate 100% game completion.

If you have completed the prerequisite mission, then you will not have to worry about spending any money on a casino membership. This mission is called “The Big Score” and it’s available after you have completed the story mode. Once you have completed this mission, you will unlock a new area in Los Santos that has a casino called the “Vault Poker Room.”

If you don’t want to complete the prerequisite mission, then you can purchase a property that’s worth at least $2 million. There are many different properties that are worth this amount, but some of the most popular ones include the following: Sonar Collections Dock, Eclipse Towers, The Richman Mansion, and Mount Chiliad Chalet.

Finally, if you don’t want to complete the prerequisite mission or purchase a property, then you can accumulate 100% game completion. This will give you access to the Vault Poker Room automatically without having to do anything else.
