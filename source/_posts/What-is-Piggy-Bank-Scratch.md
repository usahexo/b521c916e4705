#  What are the rules of Piggy Bank Scratch?

Piggy Bank Scratch is a game that is played by scratching off squares on a grid to reveal a picture underneath. The object of the game is to match three pictures in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the player does not have any pictures that match, they can choose to “scratch” another square on the grid, which will cost them one point. The player has three chances to scratch off squares on the grid. If they do not match any pictures after scratching off three squares, then their game is over and they lose.

The game begins with the player choosing one of two options: play as a beginner or play as an expert. If the player chooses to play as a beginner, then they are given a 4x4 grid with 12 pictures underneath. If the player chooses to play as an expert, then they are given an 8x8 grid with 48 pictures underneath. The player then selects four of those pictures to be their winning row and marks them off on their grid.

To play the game, the player clicks on a square to reveal what is underneath. If it is one of their chosen winning pictures, then they mark that picture off on their grid and select another square to reveal. If it is not one of their chosen winning pictures, then they can either scratch another square (costing them one point) or leave it blank and select another square to reveal. If at any time the player reveals all four of their winning pictures, then they win the game! Otherwise, if they lose all their points by scratching squares off or if they choose not to scratch any more squares after revealing three losers, then they lose the game.
