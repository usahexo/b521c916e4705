One way is to ensure that the spouse has plenty of healthy foods to eat. Foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat proteins are all excellent choices. These foods will provide the necessary vitamins and minerals needed for testosterone production. Additionally, it is important to avoid fatty or processed foods which can have a negative impact on hormone levels.

Another way to increase testosterone levels is through exercise. Exercise helps to improve overall health and wellbeing, including hormone production. Moderate exercise such as biking, running, or swimming is ideal for boosting testosterone levels. However, it is important not to overdo it as too much exercise can actually have the opposite effect.

Finally, it is important to reduce stress levels. When stress levels are high, it can lead to decreased testosterone production. Ways to reduce stress include relaxation techniques such as yoga or meditation, and spending time with friends and family.

By following these simple tips, you can help get your spouse's testosterone levels back up and improve your relationship in the process!

According to a study led by the University of Utah, playing the Solar Wilds video game can increase men's testosterone levels. Researchers studied how video game play can be linked with changes in the testosterone levels of 48 college-age men over a period of two weeks.

The men were randomly placed into one of three groups: those who played Solar Wilds, those who played a different commercially available video game called Call of Duty 2, and a control group that did not play any video games. Before and after playing the games, the researchers measured the men's blood testosterone levels using a lab test.

The findings, which are published in the journal PLOS One, show that playing Solar Wilds increased blood testosterone levels by six percent on average. In contrast, playing Call of Duty 2 decreased testosterone levels by 11 percent on average, while no changes were observed in the control group.

"Our findings suggest that playing Solar Wilds may help get your spouse's testosterone back on track," said senior author Jesse Slade Shantz, an assistant professor of family and consumer studies at U."It seems that something in this game was prompting spikes in blood testosterone."

The study is small and does not prove that Solar Wilds is responsible for increasing testosterone levels. However, it provides some evidence for claims made by some scientists and clinicians that playing certain video games can help increase or maintain men's testosterone levels.

"This is preliminary research, but it's an interesting finding," said lead study author Michael Gillings, a postdoctoral fellow at U."We need more research to determine whether this association is seen in other populations and what mechanisms might be underlying it."


So far there is little evidence to support the idea that playing video games can have negative effects on men's health. Some previous studies have shown that excessive gaming can lead to problems such as obesity, poor mental health, and lower academic achievement. However, these studies generally focus on gaming in general rather than specific types of games.

The new study suggests that there may be some benefits to playing video games such as Solar Wilds. These benefits may vary depending on the individual game and the person's gender. More research is needed to determine whether these benefits are seen in other populations and which specific types of games are most beneficial.

Marriage is a beautiful thing, but like any relationship it takes work. One aspect of any marriage that requires maintenance is the hormone balance between partners. When the testosterone in one spouse drops, often the other spouse suffers. Luckily, there is a new game on the market that can help boost the testosterone levels of the spouse who has lost ground – Solar Wilds Game.

So how does Solar Wilds Game work? It's simple – you just need to download the game to your smart phone or computer and start playing. The game itself is based on managing an animal sanctuary, and as you progress through the levels you unlock new animals to care for. Each animal in the game releases a specific type of energy which can be absorbed by the player character. As you absorb more and more of this energy, your testosterone levels will start to rise.

What are the benefits of increasing your testosterone levels? Well, for one thing, your sex drive will increase as well as your overall energy and vitality. You'll feel more alert and focused, and better able to take on whatever challenges come your way. Additionally, your overall mood will improve as negative emotions such as stress and anxiety dissipate. And last but not least, you'll look better too – with higher testosterone levels comes improved muscle mass and reduced body fat.
