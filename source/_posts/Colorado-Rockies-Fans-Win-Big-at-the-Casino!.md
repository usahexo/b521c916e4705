#  Colorado Rockies Fans Win Big at the Casino!

The Colorado Rockies baseball team is having an amazing season this year, and their fans are getting in on the action too! Many Rockies fans have visited the nearby casino and won big.

Just last week, one lucky fan walked away with over $8,000 after hitting a blackjack jackpot. Another fan hit a royal flush at the poker table and won nearly $7,000. And those are just two recent examples – there have been many other Colorado Rockies fans who have cashed in at the casino this year.

So if you're a Rockies fan, be sure to head on over to the casino and see if you can't win yourself some big bucks! You may just be the next one to walk away with a massive payday.

#  Rockies Fans rake in the casino winnings!

Colorado Rockies fans had a great 2018 season as their team made it to the playoffs for the first time in eight years. The Rockies’ exciting brand of baseball, led by sluggers Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon, kept the fans entertained all season long.

And now, it looks like the fans are being rewarded with some big casino winnings. According to a recent study by online gambling site Bodog, Rockies fans were the luckiest in all of baseball last year. The study looked at how often each team’s fans won money while betting on games.

The Rockies came out on top, with their fans winning cash at a rate of 57%. This was well ahead of the next closest team, the Seattle Mariners, who had a winning percentage of just 46%. In fact, every other team in baseball had a winning percentage below 50%.

So what does this mean for Rockies fans? It means that if you put your money on Colorado games last year, you were more likely to come out ahead than if you bet on any other team in baseball. Of course, this doesn’t mean that you can’t still lose money betting on baseball – there is no such thing as a sure thing in sports betting. But if you did bet on the Rockies last year and they delivered a winning record, you came out ahead more often than not.

Now that the Rockies are back in the playoffs again this year, there is no reason not to keep riding their hot streak! So if you’re looking for some action this October, why not put your money on Colorado to bring home another championship?

#  Colorado Rockies Fans Cash in on Casino Winnings!

The Colorado Rockies have been on a hot streak recently and their fans are cashing in on the wins! One fan, in particular, has won big at a casino and is planning to buy some season tickets with her winnings.

The fan, who does not want to be identified, won nearly $7,000 playing blackjack at a casino near Denver. "I was really lucky," she said of her win. "I was betting conservatively and just happened to get some really good cards."

She plans to use some of the money to purchase season tickets for the upcoming baseball season. "I've been a Rockies fan since they came to town," she said. "I'm excited to see them play in person this year."

Other fans are also taking advantage of the team's success. Dog-food maker Rascal Flatts is giving out free treats to fans who show up at games wearing Rockies gear. And one local brewery is offering free beers to fans who present a ticket stub from a game in which the Rockies scored 10 or more runs.

Colorado's success this season has been a welcome surprise for fans of the team. The Rockies had a dismal 2017 season, finishing last in their division with a record of 68-94. This year, they are currently in first place in their division with a record of 49-36.

Many experts had written off the Rockies going into the 2018 season, but they have managed to exceed expectations and are poised for a playoff run. Fans are hoping that this Cinderella story will continue all the way through October.

#  Rockies Fans find winning at casino pays off!

For Colorado Rockies fans, the team’s success this season is translating into some big payoffs at the casino.

According to data from the analytics firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, since the start of the baseball season, gamblers have wagered more than $1 billion on sports in the state of Nevada, with about 60 percent of that action devoted to baseball betting. The vast majority of that money has gone on the Boston Red Sox, who are currently favored to win the World Series.

But while most bettors are losers in the end, Rockies fans seem to be winning by betting on their own team. Thanks to a combination of good luck and smart strategy, dedicated Rockies fans have managed to turn a profit on their gambling this season.

To figure out who is winning and losing at gambling on the Rockies this year, we analyzed data from Sports Insights, a company that tracks betting trends for all major sports. According to their figures, Rockies fans have won about 54 percent of their bets on their team this year. On average, they’ve made about $206 in profits per game wagered.

This isn’t as good as it sounds though – because Rockies games have been relatively low-scoring affairs this year (the average total number of runs scored in a Rockies game is only 7), most bettors haven’t risked very much money on them. In fact, if you look at how much money Sports Insights says has actually been won by Rockies fans when betting on their team, it only amounts to about $2.5 million so far this season.

Still, even small profits can add up over time – and there’s still plenty of baseball left to be played. So if you’re a Rockies fan looking for some extra income, it might be worth putting a few bucks down on your favorite team at the casino. You may not become a millionaire overnight, but you could certainly come out ahead in the end!

#  Colorado Rockies fans score big at the casino

A recent study found that Colorado Rockies fans are more likely to visit a casino than fans of other Major League Baseball teams.

The study, conducted by the University of Las Vegas, looked at how often fans of each team visited a casino in the past year. The results showed that Rockies fans were more than twice as likely to visit a casino as fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Researchers believe that the findings could be due to the fact that the Rockies play in a smaller market than teams like the Dodgers and the New York Yankees. With less competition for entertainment dollars, Rockies fans may be more inclined to visit a casino.

Whatever the reason, it’s clear that Colorado casinos are benefiting from the love of baseball among Rockies fans. In fact, some casinos have even created special promotions and offers specifically for Rockies fans.

If you’re a fan of the Colorado Rockies, there’s no reason not to visit your local casino and take advantage of these great deals. You may even find yourself hitting it big at the slots or blackjack table!
