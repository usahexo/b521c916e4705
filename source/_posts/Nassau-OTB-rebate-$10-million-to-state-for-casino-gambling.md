#  Nassau OTB rebate $10 million to state for casino gambling

The Nassau Off-Track Betting Corp. announced Monday it is rebate $10 million to the state as part of its effort to win a casino gambling license.

Nassau OTB President Phil Sincere said the rebate "demonstrates our overwhelming support for a gaming facility in Nassau County and our commitment to returning a portion of our revenues to the taxpayers."

The state's Gaming Commission will award four casino licenses this year, one each for upstate, the Catskills, Rochester and Southern Tier. A proposal by Suffolk County OTB to build a casino at Belmont Racetrack is also in the running.

Nassau OTB's proposed casino would be built at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. The return of $10 million would be spread over three years, with $3 million each year going to the state's general fund and $1 million each year going to Nassau County.

Sincere said he expects the rebate will "clear any issue of concern raised by the Gaming Commission."

In January, the commission raised questions about Nassau OTB's ties to labor unions and its history of financial problems.

#  Nassau OTB making big plans with casino money

After Nassau OTB announced that it is set to receive a $12.5 million payout from the casino referendum, officials say they are looking to make big plans for the money.

"This is great news for Nassau OTB and for our customers," said Chairman Tim Moore in a statement. "We are looking forward to using this money to improve our facilities and enhance our customer experience."

Moore says that the money will be used to upgrade the existing facility as well as help fund new projects, including a proposed satellite location in Garden City and an expansion of the betting platform to include international races.

"This is a significant investment in our future and will help us grow our business and better serve our customers," Moore said.

The $12.5 million payout is coming from the state's share of casino revenue generated by Nassau County residents. The total amount of revenue generated by casinos in the county is still being calculated, but it is estimated that it will be in the range of $100 million annually.

Nassau OTB has been struggling in recent years, with declining revenues and shrinking profits. The infusion of casino money is seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the organization.

"This is great news for Nassau OTB and for our customers," Moore said. "We are looking forward to using this money to improve our facilities and enhance our customer experience."

#  What will Nassau OTB do with all that casino money?


Nassau OTB is looking to invest millions of dollars in its racetracks and other gambling facilities. What will they do with all that casino money?

The head of Nassau OTB, Jason Juliano, says the organization is in a strong financial position after a successful year at the betting windows. Nassau OTB took in $239 million in bets last year, up from $225 million in 2017.

Much of that money will now go back into the gambling industry, with plans to invest $30 million in upgrades at Aqueduct Racetrack and spend another $20 million on its other facilities, including Resorts World Casino in Queens and Belmont Park.

"This is about reinvesting in our product," Juliano said. "We are seeing good results and we want to continue to capitalize on that."

The investments come as New York gears up for expanded sports betting, which is expected to bring even more revenue to OTBs across the state. Nassau OTB is also looking into online gambling opportunities.

#  Nassau OTB enjoys windfall from casino gambling

Nassau OTB, the organization that oversees horse racing and gambling in Nassau County, New York, has announced that it has received a $2 million windfall from casino gambling. The money will be used to fund county operations and boost the local economy.

“This is great news for Nassau County,” said Nassau OTB president Tom Rogers in a statement. “The infusion of funds will help us support our horseracing and simulcasting operation, as well as provide much-needed economic stimulus to local businesses.”

Nassau OTB revealed that the bulk of the money, about $1.4 million, came from slot machine revenue at Resorts World Casino in Queens. The rest came from other casinos in upstate New York.

Rogers thanked the state legislature for its support of casino gambling and pledged to use the money “wisely and efficiently” for the benefit of county residents. He also promised that any surplus funds would be returned to the taxpayers.

Nassau OTB is not the only beneficiary of casino gambling revenue; the state of New York collected more than $2 billion in taxes from casinos last year.

#  Casino profits help Nassau OTB erase deficit

The Nassau Off-Track Betting Corp.'s $1.5 million profit in the fiscal year that ended March 31 helped erase its deficit, officials said.

Nassau OTB recorded a $1.4 million loss in the previous fiscal year, officials have said.

However, the corporation, which operates video lottery terminal facilities at nine locations in Nassau County, still owes the state more than $27 million in gambling subsidies.

"The profits we generated helped us reduce our debt to the state and position OTB for future growth," board Chairman Frederick Ippolito said in a statement Thursday.

In the fiscal year that ended March 31, Nassau OTB's revenues totaled $13.8 million, up from $11 million in the previous fiscal year. Expenses totaled $12.3 million, down from $13.7 million.

The increase in profit was largely due to an increase in the total amount wagered by bettors, from $535 million to $584 million, officials said.
