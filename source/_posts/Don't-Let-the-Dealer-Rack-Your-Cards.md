#  Don't Let the Dealer Rack Your Cards

 dealers are known to “rack the cards” while they are dealing in order to stack the deck in their favor. There is a simple move you can make, called “burning the cards,” that will prevent the dealer from being able to do this and help ensure a fair game.

When you are dealt your first card in blackjack, if it’s an Ace, place it face up on the table. This is your “burn card.” When the dealer starts to deal, don’t let them rack your cards – instead, keep them together in your hand. If the dealer wants to take another card, tell them “no thanks” and wait for them to offer the deck back to you. When you finally take a hit or stand, give the dealer your cards face down.

This simple move makes it impossible for the dealer to rack your cards and helps keep the game fair. So next time you hit the casino, remember to burn those cards!

#  Don't Split Tens

In poker, there is a common saying, "don't split tens." What this means is that if you are dealt two 10s, you should not split them up and gamble on getting a better hand. You are much more likely to end up with a lower-valued hand if you do this, so it's usually wiser to just hold onto the two 10s.

The same principle can be applied in business and in life more generally. When faced with an opportunity or a decision, it's often best to take the conservative route and not risk splitting up what you have. In many cases, the potential rewards of taking a risk simply aren't worth the potential consequences of making a mistake.

Of course, there are times when it's necessary to take risks in order to achieve success. But those risks should always be considered carefully and weighed against the potential rewards and costs. In most cases, it's best not to split tens.

#  Don't Insist on a Hit When You Have 17

In baseball, a "hit" is a term used to describe when a batter makes contact with the ball and successfully advances it to another player. A hit can be either a single, double, triple, or home run. To achieve success as a batter, you must put the ball in play and make good contact.

There are many different ways to make good contact with the ball and advance it to another player. You can use your bat to hit the ball on the ground (a ground ball), hit the ball in the air (a fly ball), or even bunt the ball. However, simply making contact with the ball is not always enough. If you don't make good contact, you won't get a hit.

One of the biggest mistakes that young players make is trying to force a hit when they don't have one. If you're not seeing results at the plate, don't try to swing for the fences. Instead, focus on getting good hits and putting the ball in play. This will increase your odds of getting on base and allow your teammates to do their job.

When you do get a hit, make sure you take advantage of it. Get into scoring position and give yourself a chance to drive in runs. Don't waste your hits by trying to do too much or running into outs. Use your speed and smarts to advance as far as possible and help your team win games.

The most important thing is to stay positive at the plate. No matter how many times you strike out or pop up, never lose confidence in yourself. Keep swinging until you finally connect with one of those balls and help your team win some games!

#  Don't Stand on 18 Against a Dealer's 6

There are some very basic blackjack tips that one should always keep in mind, no matter what the situation. One such basic rule is to never stand on an 18 when the dealer shows a 6. This guide will explain why that is the case, and provide some alternatives for players in such a scenario.

When it comes to blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. That being said, it's always important to remember that the dealer also has a chance to go over 21, so it's not always wise to take too many risks. When the dealer has a 6 showing and the player has an 18, it's typically better to hit than stand. This is because there is a good chance that the dealer will end up with a higher card than 18 (since there are only 4 cards left in the deck that are worth +2 or less), which would result in the player losing even if they do hit.

There are times when it might make sense to stand on an 18 against a dealer's 6, depending on the situation. For example, if the player has another card that would give them a total of 20 or 21, then they might want to stand in order to guarantee themselves at least a push. Additionally, if there are very few cards left in the deck and the player knows that their next card is likely to be high (e.g. an Ace), then they might want to stand as well in order to avoid busting. In any case, though, it's usually best not to risk standing on an 18 against a dealer's 6.

#  Don't Let the Dealer Push You Around

When you go to buy a new or used car, it's important to remember that you are the one in control. Don't let the dealer push you around and try to take advantage of you.

Here are a few tips to help you get the best deal on your next car:

1. Know what you want before you go to the dealership. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting talked into something that you don't want.

2. Do your research online. There are plenty of resources available online where you can compare prices and find the best deals.

3. Negotiate with the dealer. Don't be afraid to negotiate on price - most dealers expect it and are willing to work with you to get a deal that works for both parties.

4. Stick to your guns. If the dealer tries to convince you to buy more features or accessories than you want or need, don't be afraid to say no. You don't have to buy anything extra - the car is what you're interested in, not the extra features.

5. Bring a friend or family member with you who can help keep things in perspective and offer another set of eyes and ears during negotiations.

By following these tips, you'll be able to stay in control during your car buying experience and make sure that you get the best deal possible.
