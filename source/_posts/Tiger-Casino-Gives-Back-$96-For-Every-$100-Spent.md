There is nothing wrong with a small Tiger Casino gaming loss. It can help to spice up your day and make you feel more alive. However, when it starts to affect your life in a negative way, that’s when you need to get back up and start winning again. Here are some tips that can help get you back on track:

- Make a budget and stick to it. This will help you stay in control of your finances and avoid getting into too much debt.

- Try not to dwell on your losses. This will only make things worse and cause you to lose even more money.

- Be smart about how you play. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose and always try to play the odds in your favour.

- Take a break from gambling if necessary. Sometimes it’s best to just walk away and come back later when you’re feeling more motivated.
