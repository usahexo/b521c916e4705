#  What is the history of Igrosoft

Igrosoft is a Russian software company which specializes in the development of computer games, video game consoles and software for personal computers.

The company was founded on September 2, 1991, by three friends: Nikolai Lebedev, Andrei Cheglakov and Sergei Grigorovich. The first office was located in the apartment of Nikolai Lebedev.

One of the first projects of Igrosoft was porting the game Tetris to MS-DOS. Subsequently, Igrosoft developed a number of well-known games for different platforms, including vector graphics arcade game Battle City (Namco) and puzzle game Dr. Mario (Nintendo), as well as a number of games for home computers such as Iznayova Office (a suite of business applications), Klondike (a solitaire card game), and others.

Igrosoft also ported a large number of games from other developers to Russian platforms, including some popular Western titles such as Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D.

In 2006, Igrosoft released the Yarovaya law case where they revealed that they were asked by the Federal Security Service to create a backdoor into their software products that are widely used in Russia such as Windows XP and Office 2003. Igrosoft did not agree to this request and refused to include the backdoors. This made them liable to criminal charges under Russian anti-terrorism legislation passed in 2002 known as the Yarovaya law. After two years of investigation during which Igrosoft employees were harassed by Federal Security Service agents, the case was eventually dropped in 2008 for lack of evidence.
